For any NBA player, the number of points he scored per game is arguably the most significant contribution he can do for his team, even though it is not the only indicator of how valuable a player is. The player's salary is another important factor that represents the value of the player in the market overall. In this project, I investigate whether I can create a segmentation for players based on the points they scored and their corresponding salaries for the 2016-2017 NBA season. I use the K-Means algorithm and Silhouette Analysis in order to do the clustering. The dataset that is used can be accessed from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba. The name of the dataset is "nba_2016_2017_100.csv".
